Absolutely, I understand your goal of enhancing your problem-solving skills 
while thoroughly understanding each concept. Let’s focus on Step 1—creating a simple 
shell loop. Here are five problems or mini-projects that you can work on. Each one is 
designed to be progressively challenging, helping you deepen your understanding of building 
an interactive shell.

Step 1: Create a Simple Shell Loop - Five Problems
Problem 1: Basic Shell Loop that Takes Input
Goal: Implement a simple loop that prompts the user and takes input, then prints it back.

Description: Write a C program that runs an infinite loop to keep taking user input. Each
 time the user types something and presses Enter, the program should echo back what was typed. 
 Use fgets() for reading user input.
Key Learning Points:
Understand how to implement an infinite loop.
Learn how to take user input and deal with newline characters (\n).
Basics of standard input/output handling.
Additional Challenge: Make the program ignore empty input lines (i.e., just pressing 
Enter should not produce any output).

Problem 2: Implement a Customizable Prompt
Goal: Allow the user to customize the prompt string.

Description: Update the shell loop to allow the user to specify what the prompt should be.
Initially, set it to  a default string like $ , but if the user types setprompt new_prompt>,
the prompt should change to new_prompt>.
Key Learning Points:
Learn to modify program behavior dynamically based on user input.
Practice storing and using user-defined settings.
Understand how to manipulate strings in C.
Additional Challenge: Save the prompt setting so that if the user changes it and then 
reopens the shell, the previous setting is retained.

Problem 3: Adding an Exit Command to Break the Loop
Goal: Implement a command to terminate the shell.

Description: Extend the shell to allow it to terminate gracefully when the user types exit. 
The program should display a message like "Goodbye!" before closing.
Key Learning Points:
Practice breaking an infinite loop with a specific user command.
Learn to compare strings in C (strcmp()).
Reinforce control flow with loops and conditional statements.
Additional Challenge: Allow the user to type variations like exit, EXIT, or Exit,
 and handle them all correctly (hint: use case-insensitive comparison).

Problem 4: Handling Commands with Arguments
Goal: Take a command with arguments and print each part separately.

Description: Modify your shell so that if the user types a command like echo Hello World,
 your program should split the command and its arguments and print each on a separate line. 
 For this, use strtok() to tokenize the user input.
Key Learning Points:
Understand tokenization of strings to split input into command and arguments.
Practice using strtok() to handle spaces in user input.
Learn about handling variable-length user input.
Additional Challenge: Allow the user to type commands with multiple spaces between words and 
handle those correctly (i.e., skip extra spaces).

Problem 5: Simple Command History
Goal: Store the last 5 commands in memory and allow the user to view them.

Description: Extend the shell loop to keep a history of the last 5 commands entered by the user.
 When the user types history, the shell should display all the saved commands in order.
Key Learning Points:
Learn to use an array to store strings.
Understand how to manage a fixed-size buffer (i.e., only keep the last 5 commands).
Reinforce memory management and array manipulation in C.
Additional Challenge: Implement a circular buffer to store the history, so when the history
 reaches its limit, the oldest command is overwritten. This will help you understand buffer
  management effectively.

Summary of Problems in Step 1:
Basic Shell Loop that Takes Input:

Write a loop that prompts the user and echoes back input.
Ignore empty input.
Customizable Prompt:

Implement a feature to customize the prompt.
Practice modifying settings based on user input.
Add an Exit Command:

Implement an exit command to break the loop.
Handle different cases for the command (exit, EXIT, etc.).
Handling Commands with Arguments:

Split user input into command and arguments.
Practice using strtok() for tokenizing input strings.
Simple Command History:

Keep track of the last 5 commands entered.
Implement a history command to display them.
Why This Approach is Effective:
Problem-Solving Practice: Each problem isolates a key component of building an interactive
 shell. By focusing on smaller tasks, you develop a deeper understanding of each concept.
Incremental Complexity: The problems increase in complexity step-by-step, allowing you to
 apply what you’ve learned progressively.
Solid Foundation: Completing these problems will give you a solid base in shell interaction,
 user input handling, and simple state management—skills that are transferable to more complex 
 phases of the shell project.
